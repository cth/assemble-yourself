\title{Generating a randomized bioinformatics puzzle using constrained sampling with adaptive probabilities}

\begin{abstract}
We present an probabilistic logic approach to generate an educational puzzle,
with the purpose of introducing players to the principles
of next generation sequencing, gene finding and the translation of genes to
proteins proteins following the central dogma in biology. 
In the puzzle, a secret "protein word" must be found by assembling a dna sequencing
from next generation sequencing reads, locating a gene in this sequence
and translating the gene to protein.

A probabilistic logic program has been develop which generates an
instance of the game. In this program is possible constrain the
solution to adapt the difficulty of the game as well customizing
the secret protein word.

The program uses a generative approach to generate random puzzles, but
because of the randomness of the process it 
may lead to a failure to generate a satisfactory puzzle in terms of specified constraints. 
To avoid failure we employ a strategy using adaptive probabilities which change in response
to previous steps of generative process, thus minimizing the risk of failure.
