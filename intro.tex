\section*{Introduction to the game}

Recently an interesting protein with the amino acid sequence \mutantprotein was found in the bacteria \emph{S. Equencia}. 
It is now to be determined if a homologue exists in the species \emph{B. Ionformatica}.

To determine this a lab amplificied a relevant part of the DNA of \emph{B. Ionformatica} using PCR primers flanking
the gene in \emph{S. Equencia} and which are believed to be highly conserved also in \emph{B. Ionformatica}, allthough
the sequence of \emph{B. Ionformatica} is currently not known.

The amplified DNA was sequecing using Ullimina LoSeq next generation sequencing technology yielding \numberofreads high quality reads.  
Even though the reads are of high quality, read errors are expected that 1 out of twenty bases.  

As a bioinformatician you are given the task to find out if \emph{B. Ionformatica} has a homologue of the protein \mutantprotein and 
determine how its amino acid sequence differs in \emph{B. Ionformatica}.

However, the high performance grid engine supercluster is currently down (as it sometimes is) and you have to do it all by hand. 
Fortunely, you have all printed the reads. 
You task is as follows:



\begin{itemize} 
\item Perform de-novo assembly of all the reads
\item Find open reading frames that may contain a gene
\item Find the amino acid sequence of any such gene to determine if it could be a homologue to \mutantprotein
\item Report you finding and claim eternal fame (and win a prize).
\end{itemize}

But you have to hurry. Many other groups have also gotten a hold of the reads and 
may scoop you if are not the first to find the homologue.
