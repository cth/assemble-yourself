{"name":"Assemble-yourself","tagline":"cut and paste bioinformatics -- literally","body":"Assemble yourself\r\n=================\r\nAssemble yourself is a paper-printable bioinformatics boardgame which is designed to be educational, fun and engaging. \r\nIt introduces basic genetics and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) through a a puzzle-like problem. \r\n\r\nThe main idea of the game is to manually perform assembly of a genome sequence\r\nfrom NGS reads. The entire game is printed on paper. This includes the reads (cut out paperstrips) \r\nand a board which serves scaffold to assemble the reads and writing down the sequence.\r\nOnce the reads have been assembled and a consensus sequence is found, the consensus\r\nsequence is translated into amino acid sequences in both DNA strands. The letters\r\nof the amino acid sequence contains a secret word embedded within an open reading frame. \r\nOnce the player finds the secret word he wins the game. \r\n\r\nThe game is generated by a computer program and many aspects of the game can \r\nbe configured prior to generation. For instance, the secret protein word\r\ncan be changed and the minimal read depth at any loci can be configured. \r\n\r\nThe game can be played by a single person or run as a competion, e.g.,  in a class. I have experienced\r\nthe latter scenario to be a lot of fun, especially when students work in small groups. \r\n\r\nTo get the most out the game, players should have been introduced to/be familiar with the central dogma of biology\r\nand concepts like DNA, base-pairing, amino acid, strand, reading frame, gene and codon before playing the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the program\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThe computer program is implemented in PRISM, a probabilistic logic extension \r\nof Prolog language.\r\n\r\nYou can get PRISM here: http://sato-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/prism/\r\n\r\nBesides PRISM you will need a working installation of latex. The program \r\ncalls pdflatex to generate a PDF-file from the .tex file generated by \r\nthe program.\r\n\r\nOnce you have both PRISM and Latex installed, you can run the program from PRISM by\r\nstarting prism in this directory and typing:\r\n\r\n  prism(game), go([g,e,n,e]).<enter>\r\n\r\nWhere [g,e,n,e] is the secret protein name specified as a Prolog list. \r\nThis will generate the printable game as *gene.pdf* .\r\n\r\nIf you are fortunate enough to be on a Unix platform, you may also run the \r\nprogram to using game.sh hell script, e.g.,\r\n\r\n  $ ./game.sh gene\r\n\r\nThis will generate similarly generate the printable game as *gene.pdf* .\r\n\r\nYou may adjust various settings such as the minimum read depth and the \r\nread length by editing *settings.pl*.  \r\n\r\nFor the impatient, a few pregenerated games are available in the examples\r\nfolder of this repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n=========\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Christian Theil Have\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
