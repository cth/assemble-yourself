Assemble yourself
=================

Assemble yourself is a paper printable bioinformatics boardgame which is designed to be  
educational about bioinformatics and next generation sequencing and at the same
time fun and engaging.

The purpose of the game is to manually perform a assembly of a genome sequence
from next generation reads. The game is printed on paper and includes reads --- 
which must by cut out using a scissor --- a game board which is used as scaffold
to assemble the reads and writing down the consensus sequence.
Once the reads have been assembled and a consensus sequence is found, the consensus
sequence is translated to amino acid sequenced on both strands. The letters
representing the amino acid sequence contains a secret word. Once the player
finds the secret word he wins the game. 

The game is generated by a computer program and aspects of the game can 
be configured prior to generation. For instance, the secret protein word
can be changed and the minimal read depth at any loci can be configured. 

The computer program is implemented in PRISM, a probabilistic logic extension 
of Prolog language.
